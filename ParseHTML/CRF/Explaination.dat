1_Some definitions:
	PDN: product's name, 
	PDT: product's type, 
	BN: brand's name, 
	O: outside	
  About PosTag, this is the list of tag, you can see:
  https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html
2_More detail in process to labeling
	Start with the tilte of product:
		getiit joy smart wrist bsnd black
	We can have a list of word, and use setPosTag to the list:
		getiit NN
		joy NN
		smart JJ
		wrist NN
		bsnd NN
		black NN
	The list will be saved in testdata.dat as the input for CRF++
	And then CRF++ will label the list in testdata.dat, you can do
it by yourself by the way: go to cmd in the folder, and type:
	crf_test -m model testdata.dat
	The result will be shown in console
	
3_To train more data
	model file can be created when you train your data, and you can
use the file to detect label of word
	To create model file, you have to add more data in train.dat, for 
example, you add the list in the end of train.dat:
		getiit	NN	BN
		joy	NN	BN
		smart	JJ	PDN
		wrist	NN	PDN
		bsnd	NN	PDN
		black	NN	O
	The list should be separated with other by space like this:
		...
		sound	JJ	O
		speakers	NN	O
		
		getiit	NN	BN
		joy	NN	BN
		smart	JJ	PDN
		wrist	NN	PDN
		bsnd	NN	PDN
		black	NN	O
	And train data by command:
		crf_learn template train.dat model
	And then, you can use the model to test data as the step 2
